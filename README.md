# Sabbar Challenge
___

This is my attempt for Sabbar Challenge. this app is built using Flutter, and many Google Maps APIs.

|**Location Permission Handling:** Showcasing that if the user did not allow the app to access their location, the app shows the same page with the button to show the permission dialog again! but if the user granted location access, the app shows the map with the user's current location.|**Moving Around The Map:** the user can move around the map freely and smoothly.

|**Current Location:** the button in the bottom right will move the camera to the user's current location.|**Searching For Places:** the user can search for any place, street, and neighborhood to find any location faster. after typing the place's name, the user will see different results to choose from (the results are region bias for Saudi Arabia).

|**Choosing a Location:** the user can press and hold on any spot on the map to mark it.|**Jobs!, So Many Jobs!:** the user will see any job offers within 15 KM radius from the marked location. (as this is a showcase app, the results shown are for any stores near you, not real jobs).
